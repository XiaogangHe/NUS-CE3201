## About CE3201
This course aims to introduce basic data science concepts and visualization techniques to students who
are interested in climate, buildings, environment, etc. Students will gain hands-on experience in terms of how to mine, model and visualize data
to tell a compelling story of global challenges (e.g., emerging climate crisis).

### Learning Outcomes
- An understanding of visualization techniques including data models, graphical perception and methods for visual encoding and interaction.
- Exposure to several common data domains and corresponding analysis tasks, including multivariate data, networks, text and cartography.
- Practical experience building visuals from data using open-source tools and libraries, and deriving sound interpretations from them.

### Prerequisites
This module requires no prior knowledge of progamming. Only basic concepts of statistics are required. 

## Hybrid Format
CE3201 will be taught in a hybrid format with lectures and tutorials. For the most up-to-date schedule, 
you can check the [Home]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link index.md %}) page.

### Lectures
- We will have 6 lectures in total. One lecture per week. 
- These lectures will be split into two themes. The first three will focus on data analysis, 
  which will be followed by another three lectures on data visualization.  

### Tutorials
- We will have 6 tutorials in total. One tutorial per week. 
- Tutorials are prepared in Jupyter Notebook format and are fully available [online](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals). 
- We understand that sometimes programming and debugging could be cumbersome. So please come to the computer lab to do tutorials so that the TAs
  and I can provide hands-on help.
- You are welcome to seek help during office hours or through emails. But the best place to get help is the weekly tutorial session.  

### Office Hours
- Weekly fixed office hours can be found on the [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link schedule.md %}) tab, 
  and will be held either virtually or in-person depending on your needs.
- I have an open-door policy. So feel free to drop by my office for any reason, including course material clarification, 
  questions on tutorials, assignments, and projects, or even just to hang out.  

## Textbooks and Materials

- Primary textbook: [**pyCIVIL**](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/python-climate-visuals) (**py**thon **C**l**I**mate **VI**sua**L**s), 
  a free online textbook that is currently under development.
  Your comments and suggestions are welcome. 
- Supplementary textbook: [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/). (free online book; although based on `R`, 
  it is a great guide to make fabulous visualizations that correctly reflect the data). 
- A computer.
- Stable internet connection. 

## Grading Scheme

| Assignment type          | Weight   | Number      |
|:-------------------------|:---------|:------------|
| Tutorial attendance[^1]  | 20%      | 4 (+2)[^2]  |
| Homework                 | 35%      | 2           |
| Final Project            | 45%      | 1           |

[^1]: Please come to the computer lab (PC5 & PC6) on time to do tutorials. Attendance will be checked.  

[^2]: There are 6 tutorial sessions in total, but you can miss Tutorial 4 (Oct 29, Week 11) and Tutorial 6 (Nov 12, Week 13) and still receive full points.
